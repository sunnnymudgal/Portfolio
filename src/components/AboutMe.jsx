          Hi there! I'm Sunny Mudgal, a passionate full-stack developer with a
          knack for turning ideas into reality. Currently, I'm pursuing a BSc at
          Gurugram University, where my love for technology keeps growing every
          day!
        </p>

        <p>
          My coding adventure kicked off with core Java, and I've since leveled
          up to advanced Java, Spring Framework, and Spring Boot. Backend
          development is my playground, where I enjoy crafting robust
          applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the frontend, I thrive with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and React,
          building dynamic interfaces that users love. My projects range from
          simple apps to complex systems, each one enhancing my full-stack
          skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m always up for a challenge and eager to learn new technologies. I
          believe in the power of collaboration, and I’m excited about the
          possibility of working on innovative projects together.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re looking for a coding buddy or have an exciting opportunity
          in mind, let’s connect! I can’t wait to create something amazing with
          you!
